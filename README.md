# Personal Portfolio

## Description

For this application I built a webpage where I could showcase projects I have built using only HTML & CSS. 

The reason I wanted to have my own web page is because I wanted to have a one-stop shop for potential employeers, who could visit my portfolio to see all my deployed applications. Also, I want to be able to show friends & family my projects. 

During the process I learnt how to using flex-box grids to display my projects & how to use the justify-content property within CSS. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code.

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Usage

## Features

For this application there is a navigation bar within the header which includes more in depth information, which you can access by clicking any of the links to jump straight to the section. Also, there is the open to scroll down the page using the scroller. 

Lastly, my personal social media can be accessed by clicking on the 'contact me' link in the header naviagtion.
